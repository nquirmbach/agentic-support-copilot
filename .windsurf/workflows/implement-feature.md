description: Implement feature according to TODO list
auto_execution_mode: 1

Read the TODO.md inside the root folder.
**IMPORTANT** If no TODO.md exists, warn the user that the `plan-feature` workflow must be executed first and exit the conversation

Otherwise, let's start implementing:

- Create a feature branch containing the phase name
- Start implementing features one-by-one
- After any feature is finished and the user has reviewed it, create feature doc like `phase00-feat001-test.md`
- Mark off the stories and feature inside the todo markdown
