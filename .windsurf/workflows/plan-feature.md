description: Plan a new feature

This workflow is started when a new feature should be implemented. As your first step read the following file:

- docs/CONTEXT.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md

The context should give you an overview what the project is about. From the roadmap you should get the next phase to implement.

Before you starting implementing anything let's do a detailed planning. For that create a TODO.md inside the root folder, where you split the phase into feature & user stories, that we work off in the future, so we don't loose context.
