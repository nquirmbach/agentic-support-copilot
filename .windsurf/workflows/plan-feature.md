This workflow is started when a new feature should be implemented. As your first step read the following file:

- docs/CONTEXT.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md

The context should give you an overview what the project is about. From the roadmap you should get the next phase to implement.

Before you starting implementing anything let's do a detailed planning. For that create a TODO.md inside the root folder, where you split the phase into feature & user stories, that we work off in the future, so we don't loose context. Ask the user all missing information so the TODO is fully complete. The phase name should the doc title.

The todo should in format of a checklist, so we mark off features and stories.

After all add a comment to the phase inside the roadmap, that it is currently implemented.
