# CONTEXT.md

This document describes the **business, user, and product context** for the Agentic Support Copilot project.

---

# 🌟 Purpose

The goal of the project is to build a realistic, modern **agentic AI system**, reflecting what leading AI engineering teams expect today.  
It demonstrates:

- multi-agent orchestration
- RAG+ retrieval
- guardrails & moderation
- observability (latency, token usage)
- high-quality response generation
- clean UX for interacting with agentic systems

The project is designed as an advanced side project and portfolio piece.

# 🎯 Product Concept

The **Agentic Support Copilot** transforms customer support messages into draft replies.

User flow:

1. User pastes a support ticket or customer message.
2. The system:
   - analyzes intent and sentiment
   - retrieves relevant knowledge
   - drafts a grounded reply
   - validates safety and correctness
3. User sees:
   - final AI-generated answer
   - used knowledge snippets
   - full agent trace (step-by-step reasoning path)
   - latency & token metrics

# 👤 Target User

Primary target user:

- The **developer building the project**, and
- Recruiters / hiring managers evaluating AI engineering capability.

The purpose is to demonstrate applied skills, not to ship a commercial SaaS.
